# chbh_eeg_labjack PYTHON code
Code to send event markers to Actiview (Biosemi) via the LabJack U3 in Python. 

The functions to send triggers etc can be found in file: LabjackU3.py

Note that this has only been tested in Python 3 with OpenSesame, but it should work the same for PsychoPy etc.

If using with OpenSesame, copy all files in this folder to the OpenSesame root directory, and then call them from your OpenSesame experiment file.

To use with other Python-based systems, copy all files in this folder to either the Python 'site-packages' directory or to the same directory as the Python executable.
